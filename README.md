> Airline unlabelled events detection

> This is a project aiming to use machine learning to better detect unlabelled events, knowledge of which can provide advantages in airline revenue management.

> A time series forecasting model is used to predict ticket sales as a function of both charge date and flight date.

> The hypothesis is that a time series forecast sufficiently optimized can allow for realtime outlier detection that may be caused by an unlabelled event.

> Best case end goal is to combine outlier detection with an LLM API capable of searching the web to look for causes of demand surges with geographic and date context.
